# Learning-concepts
In JavaScript, an object is an unordered collection of properties. Each property consists of a key/value pair, 
and can reference either a primitive (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans, etc.) or another object. Unlike elements in an array, 
which are accessed by a numeric index, properties in objects are accessed by their key name using either 
square bracket notation or dot notation. For a closer look at object fundamentals, check out Intro to JavaScript linked below.
